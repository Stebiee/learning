Attributes, Classes, ID's

attributes allow you to modify the behavior of an html attribute
    the anchor tag used "href" to provide the link to some page or website
    "type" was also used on the input tag to specify the type of input
        like text, color, radio, checkbox

class attribute
    are used to create classes to modify in CSS
    would be used on a large scope of similarly grouped elements
id attribute
    are used to create id's to modify in CSS
    would be used for single elements or a small scope of elements
    are supposed to be unique and used once so not advisable to use
